          <h3>Chicken</h3>
          <p>Perhaps a simplistic review of what a chicken is could be helpful in understanding some of the "hows" and "whys" in poultry incubation, production, management, and health.

A chicken is a bird. One of the features that differentiate it from most other birds is that it has a comb and two wattles. The comb is the red appendage on the top of the head, and the wattles are the two appendages under the chin. These are secondary sexual characteristics and are more prominent in the male. A few other birds have a comb or similar appendage, in some cases bearing a different name such as helmet in the guinea, and a few have wattles with some having a single median one rather than a pair. The comb is the basis of the Latin name or classification of chickens. In Latin, gallus means comb, and the domestic chicken is Gallus domesticus. The Red Jungle Fowl, ancestor of most domestic chickens, is Gallus bankiva. There are eight recognized kinds of combs: single, rose, pea, cushion, buttercup, strawberry, V-shaped, and silkie.

The chicken has two legs and two wings, a fact that influences housing and management. Domestic chickens have essentially lost the ability to fly. Heavy breeds used for meat production cannot do more than flap their wings and jump to a little higher level or move more rapidly along the ground. The lighter-bodied birds can fly short distances, and some can fly over relatively high fences. The feet and shank portions of the legs have scales.

Respiration rate is higher in chickens than in larger animals. In general, it can be said that the smaller the kind of bird the faster it breathes. For example, a hummingbird breathes more times a minute than a chicken. The male chicken breathes about 18 to 21 times a minute and the female about 31 to 37 times when they are not under stress.

The heart beat of chickens is rather fast, being about 286 times a minute in males and 312 in females in a resting condition.

Digestion rate is somewhat rapid in chickens. It varies from 2 1/2 to 25 hours for passage of food depending on whether the digestion tract is full, partially full, or empty when feed is ingested.

The chicken's temperature is about 107 degrees to 107.5 degrees F.

Chickens are hatched, not born in the truest sense of the word.

Chickens are covered with feathers but have a few vestigial hairs scattered over the body. The average consumer does not see these hairs, because they are singed off in the processing plant. The chicken has a beak (or bill) and does not have teeth. Any mastication occurs in the gizzard. Many commercial poultry producers do not provide grit to their chickens, because they feed a ground feed of fine meal consistency that can be digested by the bird's digestive juices.

The chicken has pneumatic bones, making its body lighter for flying, if it had not lost the ability to do so.

There are 13 air sacs in the chicken's body, again to make the body lighter, and they are a functioning part of the respiratory system.

Chickens have comparatively short life spans. Some live to be 10 to 15 years old, but they are the exception, not the rule. In commercial egg production, birds are about 18 months old when they are replaced by new, young stock. It takes close to six months for a female chicken to mature sexually and start laying eggs. Then, they are kept for 12 to 14 months of egg production. After that their economic value declines rapidly, so they are disposed of when they are about 18 months old.

Chickens have both white (breast) and dark meat. </br>

          <h3>Beef</h3>
          <p>Going forward, rearing cattle on certified organic fodders is turning out to be more profitable than conventional practices. Growing concerns of consumers over food safety has propelled the demand for organic foods, and has incidentally affected the global beef production. Particularly in developed markets, the demand for organic beef meat is gaining traction pertaining to the rising confidence of consumers towards organic beef over regular beef. The main difference between these options lies in the fodder fed to the cattle, at which point organic fodder is healthier and nutritious than regular cattle feed.

In 2017, over 1.5 million metric tonnes of organic beef meat is anticipated to be consumed across the globe. Future Market Insights’ recent study on global organic beef meat market projects that by the end of this year, the global market will be valued a little over US$ 8.8 Bn. Large retail chains such as Whole Foods are already boosting the presence of organic agricultural produce in their store shelves, and this trend is also expected to promote the availability of organic beef meat. TESCO, a prominent retail chain in the UK, is following this path by offering organic beef in various processed formats, and under its own label.

The report projects that by the end of 2027, the value of global market for organic beef meat will get doubled, surpassing US$ 16.4 Bn and reflecting a healthy CAGR of 6.4%. Higher on-shelf availability of organic beef meat products in countries such as the UK vindicates the report’s key finding that observes Western Europe as a leading region in the global market. The report anticipates that through 2027, around 30% of organic beef meat consumed in the world will be concentrated in Western Europe.

          <h3>Sushi</h3>
          <p>is popular around the world, but that doesn't mean everyone understands what this dish technically is. Sushi isn't the same thing as raw fish, for instance. Rather, raw fish, known as sashimi in Japanese, is the most popular ingredient in sushi.


It may surprise Westerners to find out that the term sushi actually refers to foods that use a type of rice seasoned with vinegar, not just the rolled rice and seaweed variety we see at most establishments in the United States.

If you're traveling to Japan or just want to learn more about the cuisine, the best thing to do is to read up on the different types sushi and prepare your taste buds for some true Japanese delicacies.

The Different Types of Sushi
There are several types of sushi, making it an appealing food to people with a wide range of tastes. One form of sushi, nigiri-zushi, are hand-pressed mounds of rice with a dab of wasabi and parts of various ingredients on top. Popular nigiri-zushi include maguro (tuna), toro (belly of tuna), hamachi (yellowtail), and ebi (shrimp).

Maki-zushi are sushi rolls wrapped by nori seaweed, such as tekkamaki (tuna rolls) and kappamaki (cucumber rolls). These rolls are also called norimaki. Additionally, inari-zushi are deep-fried tofu pouches stuffed with sushi rice which are brown and oval-shaped. and chirashi-zushi are sushi served on a plate or bowl with different ingredients on top of rice.

The key seasonings used in sushi are soy sauce and wasabi (Japanese horseradish). Soy sauce is used as a dipping sauce, and wasabi is put in nigiri-zushi and may also be mixed with soy sauce for dipping. Also, pickled ginger called gari is commonly served with sushi while green tea (agari) is the best drink to pair with sushi.

Where to Get Authentic Japanese Sushi
In traditional sushi restaurants in Japan, sushi can be expensive depending on what you eat, but these restaurants can be found all over the country. Here, you can usually order a set of sushi with a fixed price, which comes in handy for group outings, or you can order your favorite sushi pieces as you eat your meal.

For reasonably priced sushi, there are places called kaiten-zushi, where the sushi plates circle around the eating area on a conveyor belt, and these restaurants are also found everywhere in Japan. When you go to such a restaurant, you wait until your favorite sushi comes near you, and then pick up the plate from the moving table. If your favorites aren't available on the moving table, you can also order them from the kitchen. Prices for this inexpensive kind of sushi vary.

Once considered exotic outside of Japan, sushi restaurants can now even be found in small American towns. If you'll likely never visit Japan, the most authentic sushi in America can usually be located in coastal cities with large Japanese populations such as Los Angeles, Seattle, or Honolulu. TESCO, a prominent retail chain in the UK, is following this path by offering organic beef in various processed formats, and under its own label. The report projects that by the end of 2027, the value of global market for organic beef meat will get doubled, surpassing US$ 16.4 Bn and reflecting a healthy CAGR of 6.4%. Higher on-shelf availability of organic beef meat products in countries such as the UK vindicates the report’s key finding that observes Western Europe as a leading region in the global market.
